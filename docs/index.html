<h2 is-upgraded><strong>AA-Aid?</strong></h2>
<p>As members of the SUTD community, we are taught to design and build innovative products, to dive in and explore things that interest us, and to use our knowledge to creatively problem-solve. However, a common blocker that many of us face is unsurprisingly a lack of funding. In order to foster a greater culture of exploration and building, the SUTD Alumni Association has come up with AA-Aid - an open-source platform that supports SUTD&#39;s growing ecosystem through project funding.</p>
<p>This platform aims to solve the common issues of project funding, namely,  accountability, transparency, and longevity. As donors ourselves, we understand how futile it might feel to donate to a cause and not know what your money might be used for, or how much of it even went towards the cause. On the project side, many projects simply become one and done, with throwaway final products, destined to be repeated by a different group of juniors down the road.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Objectives</strong></h2>
<p>We want a system that optimises the allocation of project donations in a very transparent manner. AA-Aid intends to connect <strong>managers </strong>(project managers, event organisers, fifth row leaders, etc) with <strong>supporters </strong>(literally anyone willing to contribute!). Instead of the traditional method of donating directly to the organisation and giving it free reign, supporters can now pick and choose the projects that they feel are worth supporting. High quality projects that provide value to the community would naturally rise to the top and hit their budget goals. This would then hopefully incentivise submitting higher quality projects.</p>
<p>Each project would be required to provide a breakdown of their budget and clear objectives that need to be met. Funds will only be released to the projects once they prove that these objectives are met. This provides transparency in how they will be spending the money, and also accountability in that they are unable to claim the funds and abandon the project.</p>
<p>Even after it ends, if relevant, the project will be archived along with its various progress updates and the final product. Anyone would be able to access these files at any time, allowing for a continuous cycle of learning and building upon previous projects.</p>
<p>Of course, not all projects would be work related. AA-Aid can also support community events such as funding a community outing (after Covid measures have subsided of course), or sponsoring new basketballs for the basketball fifth row. The best part is that if you don&#39;t feel for any of these causes, you can simply choose not to participate in their funding!</p>
<aside class="warning"><p>Interested in the exact mechanisms and technologies we used to achieve this? We discuss them in detail here</p>

      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Supporter Guide" duration="2">
        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Basic Donation</strong></h2>
<p>This will be the simplest method of supporting projects</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Browse through projects on the notion page.</li>
<li>Once you see a project you like, take note of the <strong>Project Id.</strong></li>
<li>Transfer the amount you want to donate to the SUTDAA QR code. (Please round your donation up to the nearest dollar)</li>
<li>In the transfer description, include the Project Id and the name of the donor. You can leave an empty name if you want the donation to be anonymous.</li>
<li>That&#39;s it! We will handle the rest and ensure that the project you supported receives your donations.</li>
<li>You can check the amount donated along with your name on the project page after we are done processing it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Personal Address Donation</strong></h2>
<p>This method would require a Metamask wallet address, but will give you more flexibility in your donations.</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Make sure you have a metamask address. If you do not know how to create one, you can follow the step-by-step tutorial provided.</li>
<li>Add the token to your metamask wallet. If you do not know how to do so, you can follow this step-by-step tutorial here (add link to tutorial)</li>
<li>Transfer the amount you want to donate to the SUTDAA QR code. (Please round your donation up to the nearest dollar)</li>
<li>In the transfer description, please include your address or ENS</li>
<li>Once the donation is processed, tokens of an equivalent amount will be transferred to your metamask wallet.</li>
<li>You can view your tokens in the <strong>Assets </strong>tab on metamask</li>
<li>You can now browse through projects on the notion page and donate any amount of your tokens to any listed project.</li>
<li>You can check the amount donated along with your name on the project page after the transaction is processed.</li>

<p>AA-Aids does not use the Ethereum Mainnet, but instead uses the <strong>Ropsten Test Network</strong>, which means all tokens and Ether are <strong>not real</strong>. You will not be able to convert anything on the testnet to real cash, so don&#39;t try it. But this also means that all transaction fees will be free!</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Creating an Ethereum Name Service" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>What is an Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and why is it useful?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, an Ethereum address is a very long string of random characters that looks like this: <code>0x49c6a7f9F3755C810d5DDFaf029817742C46BE2b</code>.This address is pretty difficult to remember  and is not easily identifiable. You can register your wallet address to an ENS like <code>sutdaa.eth</code> which creates a two way mapping between your wallet address and your short name. This means that you can now interact with smart contracts with your shortened name. Think of it as instead of having to type in 69.171.250.35 (Facebook&#39;s ip address) in your browser every time you want to rant about your terrible day, all you need to do is type in facebook.com which then reroutes you to the same Facebook page.</p>
<p>We want to use ENS so that it becomes easier to identify which projects belong to which addresses. For example, if a supporter wants to identify </p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>tl;dr: ENS helps map </strong><code>0x49c6a7f9F3755C810d5DDFaf029817742C46BE2b</code><strong> to </strong><code>sutdaa.eth</code><strong>  to make it easy to remember and identify</strong></p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>How to create an ENS?</h2>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Firstly, you need an address to call your own. This can be done simply by creating a metamask account. If you haven&#39;t already done so, go look at our previous tutorial!</li>
<li>Your account needs to be funded with a little test ETH. You can follow this faucet tutorial if you are testnet broke.</li>
<li>Navigate to <a href="https://app.ens.domains/" target="_blank">https://app.ens.domains/</a> and click the connect button on the top left. Make sure that your metamask account has already been switched to the Ropsten Test Network before connecting!</li>
