        <p><br>As members of the SUTD community, we are taught to design and build innovative products, to dive in and explore things that interest us, and to use our knowledge to creatively problem-solve. However, a common blocker that many of us face is unsurprisingly a lack of funding. In order to foster a greater culture of exploration and building, the SUTD Alumni Association has come up with AA-Aid - an open-source platform that supports SUTD&#39;s growing ecosystem through project funding.<br><br>This platform aims to solve the common issues of project funding, namely,  accountability, transparency, and longevity. As donors ourselves, we understand how futile it might feel to donate to a cause and not know what your money might be used for, or how much of it even went towards the cause. On the project side, many projects simply become one and done, with throwaway final products, destined to be repeated by a different group of juniors down the road.<br><br><br></p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Objectives {#objectives}" duration="0">
        <p><br>We want a system that optimises the allocation of project donations in a very transparent manner. AA-Aid intends to connect **managers **(project managers, event organisers, fifth row leaders, etc) with **supporters **(literally anyone willing to contribute!). Instead of the traditional method of donating directly to the organisation and giving it free reign, supporters can now pick and choose the projects that they feel are worth supporting. High quality projects that provide value to the community would naturally rise to the top and hit their budget goals. This would then hopefully incentivise submitting higher quality projects.<br><br>Each project would be required to provide a breakdown of their budget and clear objectives that need to be met. Funds will only be released to the projects once they prove that these objectives are met. This provides transparency in how they will be spending the money, and also accountability in that they are unable to claim the funds and abandon the project.<br><br>Even after it ends, if relevant, the project will be archived along with its various progress updates and the final product. Anyone would be able to access these files at any time, allowing for a continuous cycle of learning and building upon previous projects.<br><br>Of course, not all projects would be work related. AA-Aid can also support community events such as funding a community outing (after Covid measures have subsided of course), or sponsoring new basketballs for the basketball fifth row. The best part is that if you don&#39;t feel for any of these causes, you can simply choose not to participate in their funding!<br><br><br><br><code>Interested in the exact mechanisms and technologies we used to achieve this?

You can register your wallet address to an ENS like <code>sutdaa.eth</code> which creates a two way mapping between your wallet address and your short name. This means that you can now interact with smart contracts with your shortened name. Think of it as instead of having to type in 69.171.250.35 (Facebook&#39;s ip address) in your browser every time you want to rant about your terrible day, all you need to do is type in facebook.com which then reroutes you to the same Facebook page.<br><br>We want to use ENS so that it becomes easier to identify which projects belong to which addresses. For example, if a supporter wants to identify <br><br><br><br><code>tl;dr: ENS helps map 0x49c6a7f9F3755C810d5DDFaf029817742C46BE2b to sutdaa.eth  to make it easy to remember and identify<br><br></code>How to create an ENS? {#how-to-create-an-ens}<br></li>
<li>Firstly, you need an address to call your own. This can be done simply by creating a metamask account. If you haven&#39;t already done so, go look at our previous tutorial!<br></li>
<li>Your account needs to be funded with a little test ETH. You can follow this faucet tutorial if you are testnet broke.<br></li>
<li>Navigate to <a href="https://app.ens.domains/" target="_blank">https://app.ens.domains/</a> and click the connect button on the top left. Make sure that your metamask account has already been switched to the Ropsten Test Network before connecting!<br><br><br><br><br><img alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" src="img/e93e301e7d65521a.png"></li>
<li>The site will prompt you to connect with your ethereum wallet. Click on metamask and select your account<br><br><br><br><br><img alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" src="img/551a89c5a175d009.png"></li>
<li>Once you have connected, you should notice the top left now says Ropsten Network, along with your wallet address<br><br><br><br><img alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" src="img/63484b6282dd758e.png"></li>
<li>Search the ENS you want inside the Search Bar<br><br><br><br><br><img alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" src="img/d1e3f3adedf2bcd7.png"></li>
<li>Click on the name that appears after you search<br><br><br><br><img alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" src="img/b9e32347a2cf6352.png"></li>
<li>If you get this page, it means that the name has already been taken. Go back to the previous page and search for another one!<br><br><br><br><img alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" src="img/45ecbc4c1f524e83.png"></li>
<li>If you get this page, that means you can register this name as yours!<br><br><br><br><img alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" src="img/ae3d97da142ccc4a.png"></li>
<li>Change the number of years if you want. The longer it is the longer you can keep the name for, but the more test ETH it will cost. Click on <code>request to register</code> when you&#39;re ready.<br></li>
<li>A metamask transaction should pop up. Click <code>confirm</code></li>
<li>Wait for the transaction to be confirmed<br><br><br><br><img alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" src="img/cbbd51fb5ae494b.png"></li>
<li>Once done, you should start to see the green bar fill. Wait for a minute<br><br><br><br><br><img alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" src="img/342d40b89c4fd8f3.png"></li>
<li>When the green bar stops moving, the register button should light up blue. Click on <code>register</code><img alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" src="img/bdd57e483d18c4e0.png"></li>
<li>A second transaction should pop up. Go ahead and confirm it.<br></li>
<li>Click on <code>set reverse record</code><img alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" src="img/a182d711ebe8247.png"></li>
<li>Select your newly created ENS in the drop down menu and click <code>save</code><img alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" src="img/1760c8b648457dd5.png"></li>
<li>Again, confirm the metamask transaction<br></li>
<li>You should see this message saying that the reverse record was set. And you&#39;re done! You can now use your ENS and your address interchangeably.<br><br><br><br><br><img alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip" src="img/8b18ab8e6d4e1640.png"><br><br><br><br><br>—<br><br><br>Interacting with the Smart Contract {#interacting-with-the-smart-contract}<br>Supporters {#supporters}<br>Projects {#projects}<br></li>
